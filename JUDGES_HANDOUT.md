# Tebra Mental Health MVP

## Substrate Intelligence for Healthcare

---

### The Problem

Healthcare providers spend **87% of their time on administrative tasks** - clicking through EHRs, documenting visits, ordering labs, sending messages. This leads to:

- Provider burnout (63% report symptoms)
- Reduced patient face time
- Increased medical errors from cognitive overload
- Staff turnover and recruitment challenges

---

### Our Solution

An **AI-first interface** that transforms how providers interact with their practice management system.

---

## POC 1: UX Transformation

**Problem:** Traditional EHRs show data. Providers must search, interpret, and decide.

**Solution:** AI-surfaced priority actions. The system thinks overnight and presents decisions in the morning.

**Result:**

- Action-first home page (not data-first)
- Priority-ranked patient needs
- Patient 360 view with clinical context
- Zero searching required

---

## POC 2: AI Engineering (HITL Orchestration)

**Problem:** Adding AI features to healthcare apps takes weeks of development.

**Solution:** Substrate architecture with Human-In-The-Loop workflow.

**How it works:**

1. AI analyzes patient data overnight
2. AI drafts recommended actions (messages, orders, follow-ups)
3. Provider reviews AI suggestions
4. Provider approves with one click
5. System executes all actions

**Result:**

- 95% faster AI integration
- Human always in control
- Audit trail for compliance
- Model-agnostic architecture
