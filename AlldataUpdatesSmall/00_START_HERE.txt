THE TWO POCS
================================================================================

POC 1: UX TRANSFORMATION (7 minutes)
---------------------------------------
"Competitors make you find data. Tebra shows you decisions."

Show home page with 5 priority action cards:
1. Click Sarah Mitchell (A1C) - URGENT
   → Show AI reasoning about integrated mental health + physical health
   → Expand to see 4 suggested actions
   → Click "Complete All Actions" 
   
2. Click David Rodriguez (SI) - URGENT  
   → Show critical safety escalation
   → Demonstrate HITL: AI suggests, human approves
   
3. Click Marcus Johnson (Refill) - HIGH
   → Show medication coordination workflow
   
4. Briefly show Emily (First Appt) and Aisha (Progress)

KEY MESSAGE: This isn't a chatbot telling you facts. It's infrastructure that 
thinks ahead and surfaces what actually needs your attention RIGHT NOW.

POC 2: AI ENGINEERING (7 minutes)
---------------------------------------
"15 minutes vs 20-40 hours. That's the difference."

1. Show Patient 360 for Sarah Mitchell
   → Demographics, key metrics
   → THE KILLER: Prioritized Actions tab
   → Expand to show AI confidence scores (94%, 98%, etc)
   → Show reasoning: "Depression resolved, new metabolic risk detected"
   → Show clinician can "drill in" or "complete all"

2. Show other tabs:
   → Appointments (clinical history)
   → Messages (communication threads)
   → Billing (6 months data)

3. Highlight the real data integration:
   → SimplePractice CSV messy/unstructured
   → Tebra system clean/structured/intelligent
   → That's the engineering excellence

4. Show Patient 360 for David Rodriguez
   → Show safety flags prominently
   → Show increased frequency recommendation
   → Show "Emergency escalation" protocol active

KEY MESSAGE: We don't just migrate data. We transform it into decision support.
