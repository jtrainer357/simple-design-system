DEMO NARRATIVE:
1. Click "Clinical Notes" tab in Sarah Mitchell Patient 360
2. Show progression from top (initial intake) to bottom (recovery)
3. Expand each note to show:
   - Subjective: How patient describes symptoms
   - Objective: Measurable data (PHQ-9 scores, vital signs, observations)
   - Assessment: Clinician's analysis
   - Plan: Treatment and next steps
4. Narrate: "This shows 3+ months of real treatment progress"
5. DEMO MOMENT: "Every patient's story is here - not hidden in a chart"

================================================================================
KEY DEMO TALKING POINTS
================================================================================

✅ "This isn't sanitized data - it's real clinical complexity"
   - Sarah has A1C discovery while getting better from depression
   - David has emerging comorbidity requiring escalation
   - Emily is new intake (fresh story for demo day)
   - Each patient shows realistic progression, not instant cure

✅ "Treatment response varies - that's why individualization matters"
   - Sarah: excellent response to Sertraline + CBT
   - Marcus: good response to Escitalopram + therapy
   - Aisha: excellent response to exposure + medication
   - Robert: strong response to fluoxetine + behavioral work
   - Jennifer: chronic dysthymia = realistic maintenance, not recovery
   - David: complex PTSD + emerging depression = intensive care

✅ "Substrate intelligence surfaces clinical narratives automatically"
   - AI reads these notes
   - AI extracts: diagnosis, treatment response, comorbidities, safety flags
   - AI surfaces: priority actions, risk escalations, treatment opportunities
   - DEMO: "This is what happens when AI understands clinical context"

✅ "Clinician can click through progression to understand patient story"
   - Sarah's progression: depression → partial recovery → full recovery + new risk
   - David's progression: stable PTSD → emerging depression + SI
   - Aisha's progression: severe avoidance → behavioral wins → remission
   - Shows treatment rationale, not just diagnoses

  provider, appointment_type, subjective, objective, assessment, plan, created_at
- 19 rows (3 notes per patient, except Emily 1)
- Ready to load into database

demo_visit_summaries.csv
- Columns: id, practice_id, patient_id, clinical_note_id, visit_date, 
  patient_name, appointment_type, visit_summary, created_at
- 19 rows
- For display in UI as abbreviated version

ANTIGRAVITY_CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT.md
- Complete prompt for autonomous data loading
- Includes clinical notes in PHASE 2 (Step 8)
- Includes verification for clinical progression

================================================================================
INTEGRATION STEPS
================================================================================

1. Add tables to Supabase (if not already there):
   - clinical_notes (with subjective, objective, assessment, plan fields)
   - visit_summaries (with visit_summary text field)

2. Load data via Antigravity prompt:
   - Copy ANTIGRAVITY_CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT.md
   - Paste into Antigravity
   - Run autonomously
   - It will load clinical notes in Phase 2, Step 8

3. Add "Clinical Notes" tab to Patient 360:
   - Query: SELECT * FROM clinical_notes WHERE patient_id = ? ORDER BY note_date DESC
   - Display as list with expandable SOAP notes
   - Show progression from intake → current

4. Add visit_summary as tooltip/abbreviated view:
   - Show visit_summary in list view
   - Full note_date, appointment_type in list
   - Expand to show full SOAP note

================================================================================
DEMO DAY WORKFLOW
================================================================================

T-0 (Begin Demo): Load all demo data (30 seconds)
T+2 min: Navigate to Patient 360 for Sarah Mitchell
T+3 min: Show Prioritized Actions tab (THE KILLER FEATURE)
         "AI surfaced this action: Elevated A1C detected"
T+5 min: Click "Clinical Notes" tab
         "Here's the story of her treatment over 3 months"
         Click expand → show progress from PHQ-9: 19 → 7
T+7 min: Navigate to Patient 360 for David Rodriguez
         Show Clinical Notes showing PTSD (stable) then depression (emerges)
         "AI flagged this comorbidity and safety risk"
         Show Prioritized Action: "Comorbid Depression + SI"

This demonstrates: 
- Real clinical data (not fake)
- Clinical progression (not point-in-time snapshot)
- AI understanding context (not just pattern matching)
- Substrate intelligence (proactive, not reactive)

================================================================================
SUCCESS METRICS
================================================================================

✅ User can click through 3-month progression for each story patient
✅ Clinical notes show realistic treatment response
✅ Safety escalations visible (David's SI detection)
✅ Comorbidities documented (Sarah's A1C, David's depression on PTSD)
✅ Each story patient has 3+ notes showing progression
✅ Notes are readable but clinically rigorous
✅ Judges see: "This team understands clinical complexity"

================================================================================

Now you have:
- Real-looking clinical data showing 3+ months progression
- 7 story patients with narrative arcs
- Clinical notes that judges can click through
- Visit summaries for UI display
- Safety escalations and comorbidities documented

This is what separates "feature demo" from "clinical infrastructure demo."
