================================================================================
4. DAVID RODRIGUEZ - Complex PTSD + EMERGING DEPRESSION (4 visits over 17 months!)
================================================================================

Visit 4: January 21, 2026 - Early intervention at month 19
├─ PHQ-9 Score: 9 (UNCHANGED - early in treatment)
├─ Treatment: Sertraline 50mg initiated (started mid-December)
├─ SI: Decreased from "2-3x/week" to "1-2x/week" (slight improvement)
├─ Status: "Frustrated with pace. Anhedonia persists. Weight still down."
├─ Safety: Weekly therapy frequency increased, family notification done
└─ Assessment: "Complex PTSD + depression requires patience and intensive support"

DEMO NARRATIVE - THE MOST IMPORTANT STORY:
"David had stable PTSD for 17 months. Then depression emerged - this is common
in complex trauma but EASY to miss. He developed passive suicidal ideation. 
Look at the Dec 15 note - without AI reading his notes, nobody would know he's
struggling with SI. THIS is why substrate intelligence exists. To catch the
comorbidity, flag the safety risk, escalate the care. Without AI monitoring,
David's depression could have gone unnoticed until crisis."

KEY TALKING POINT FOR JUDGES:
"Competitors show you data. We show you what matters. When David's depression
emerged on top of his PTSD, our system FLAGGED IT AUTOMATICALLY. We surface it
as a priority action: 'Comorbid Depression + SI Present.' That's substrate
intelligence - continuous background analysis, proactive escalation, HITL safety."

================================================================================
5. AISHA PATEL - Social Anxiety Exposure Therapy (5 visits over 5.5 months)

DEMO NARRATIVE:
"Aisha's story shows something important: outcome measures don't capture full
recovery. Her GAD-7 only dropped 5 points (17→12), but look at her ACTUAL LIFE:
went from avoiding social events to attending parties, dancing, making friends,
considering dating. THIS is why clinicians need to read the NARRATIVE, not just
the numbers. The numbers are the data. The narrative is the transformation."

6. JENNIFER LIU - Chronic Dysthymia (Long-term maintenance, 3 visits)
================================================================================

Visit 3: January 26, 2026 - Winter Management
├─ PHQ-9 Score: 8 (MINIMAL - seasonal dip managed well)
├─ Resilience: "Winter is hard but I'm managing. Better than previous years."
├─ Social: Book club checked in on her during dark months
├─ Strength: Protective factors (friendship, structure) are clear
└─ Demo Point: "Not every patient 'recovers' - some manage long-term"

DEMO NARRATIVE:
"Jennifer represents 30% of our patient base - people with chronic mental illness.
She's not getting 'better.' She's managing. She has good days and bad days. Her
PHQ-9 hovers at 7-8. And that's SUCCESS. This is what long-term care looks like.
This is what substrate intelligence needs to support - not just acute episodes,
but chronic disease management. Watch her notes - they show realistic stability,
not magical cure."

pills, not perfect outcomes, but real people getting their lives back."

================================================================================
WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE DEMO
================================================================================

When you click through Sarah Mitchell's Patient 360 → Clinical Notes tab:

📅 JUDGES WILL SEE:
- June 12: "I feel empty" (PHQ-9: 19) - Severe depression
- July 17: "Slight improvement" (PHQ-9: 15) - Medication working
- August 14: "Feel like myself again" (PHQ-9: 7) - Remission
- September 25: "A1C discovered" - Health integration moment
- November 6: "Best in years" + behavioral changes - Sustained
- January 15: "Sustainable habits" - Long-term stability

THEY'LL SEE THE PROGRESSION. NOT JUST "DEPRESSION" BUT A JOURNEY.

Same with David Rodriguez:
- August 2024: "PTSD improving with therapy" (stable)
- December 2025: "Depressed. SI present." (RED FLAG) ← AI CATCHES THIS
- January 2026: "Safety escalation. Sertraline started." (RESPONSE)

Judges will understand: This system thinks clinically. It catches comorbidities.
It escalates safety. It shows the STORY, not just the data.

================================================================================
THE KILLER MOMENT IN YOUR DEMO
================================================================================

Navigate to Patient 360 for David Rodriguez.

Click "Clinical Notes" tab.

Show the progression from August 2024 (stable PTSD) → December 2025 (depression emerges).

Point to Dec 15 note: "See here? PASSIVE SI. Weight loss. Anhedonia."

Then show the Prioritized Actions tab for David: 
"AI surfaced this automatically: 'Comorbid Depression + SI Present' - URGENT"

Then say: "WITHOUT substrate intelligence, David's depression could go unnoticed.
WITH it, the system flagged the comorbidity, the safety risk, the need for
intensive care. THAT is infrastructure that thinks clinically."

JUDGES WILL GET IT.

================================================================================

You now have:
✅ 21 SOAP format clinical notes
✅ 3 months of clinical progression for 5 story patients
✅ Real clinical narratives showing treatment response
✅ Safety escalations documented (David)
✅ Comorbidities captured (Sarah's A1C, David's depression)
✅ Behavioral transformations visible (Aisha, Robert)
✅ Long-term management visible (Jennifer)

This is what separates "feature demo" from "clinical leadership demo."
